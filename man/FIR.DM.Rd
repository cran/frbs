\usage{
  FIR.DM(data.train, num.labels, max.iter, step.size,
    type.tnorm = "MIN", type.snorm = "MAX",
    type.implication.func = "ZADEH")
}
\arguments{
  \item{data.train}{a matrix (m x n) of normalized data for
  training, where m is the number of instances and n is the
  number of variables. The last column is the output
  variable.  Note the data must be normalized between 0 and
  1.}

  \item{num.labels}{a matrix (1 x n) whose elements
  represent the number of labels (fuzzy terms), where n is
  the number of variables.}

  \item{max.iter}{the maximal number of iterations.}

  \item{step.size}{the step size of the descent method,
  between 0 and 1.}

  \item{type.tnorm}{the type of t-norm. For more detail,
  please have a look at \code{\link{inference}}.}

  \item{type.snorm}{the type of s-norm. For more detail,
  please have a look at \code{\link{inference}}.}

  \item{type.implication.func}{a value representing type of
  implication function. For more detail, please have a look
  at \code{\link{WM}}}

\description{
  This is the internal function that implements the fuzzy
  inference rules by descent method (FIR.DM). It is used to
  solve regression tasks. Users do not need to call it
  directly, but just use \code{\link{frbs.learn}} and
  \code{\link{predict}}.
}
\details{
  This method was proposed by Hiroyoshi Nomura, Isao
  Hayashi, and Noboru Wakami. FIR.DM uses simplified fuzzy
  reasoning where the consequent part is a real number (a
  particular case within the Takagi Sugeno Kang model),
  while the membership function on the antecedent part is
  expressed by an isosceles triangle. So, in the learning
  phase, FIR.DM updates three parameters which are center
  and width of the triangular and a real number on the
  consequent part using a descent method.
