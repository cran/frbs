\title{Transforming from crisp set into linguistic terms}
\usage{
fuzzifier(data, num.varinput, num.labels.input, varinp.mf)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a matrix of data containing numerical elements.}

\item{num.varinput}{number of input variables.}

\item{num.labels.input}{the number of labels of the input variables.}

\item{varinp.mf}{a matrix containing the parameters to form the membership functions. See the Detail section.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the degree of each linguistic terms based on the shape of
the membership functions
}
\description{
Fuzzification refers to the process of transforming a crisp set into linguistic terms.
}
\details{
In this function, there are five shapes of membership functions implemented,
namely \code{TRIANGLE}, \code{TRAPEZOID}, \code{GAUSSIAN}, \code{SIGMOID}, and \code{BELL}.
They are represented by a matrix that the dimension is (\eqn{5, n}) where \eqn{n} is
a multiplication the number of linguistic terms/labels and the number of input variables.
The rows of the matrix represent:
The first row is the type of membership function, where 1 means \code{TRIANGLE},
2 means \code{TRAPEZOID} in left side,
3 means \code{TRAPEZOID} in right side, 4 means \code{TRAPEZOID} in the middle,
5 means \code{GAUSSIAN},
6 means \code{SIGMOID}, and 7 means \code{BELL}. And, the second up to fifth row indicate
the corner points to construct the functions.
\itemize{
\item \code{TRIANGLE} has three parameters (\eqn{a, b, c}), where \eqn{b} is the center point of the \code{TRIANGLE},
and \eqn{a} and \eqn{c} are the left and right points, respectively.
\item \code{TRAPEZOID} has four parameters (\eqn{a, b, c, d}).
\item \code{GAUSSIAN} has two parameters (\eqn{mean} and \eqn{variance}).
\item \code{SIGMOID} has two parameters (\eqn{\gamma} and \eqn{c}) for representing steepness of the function and distance from the origin, respectively.
\item \code{BELL} has three parameters (\eqn{a, b, c}).

For example:

\code{varinp.mf <- matrix(c(2,1,3,2,3,0,30,60,0,40,20,50,80,}

\code{30,80,40,70,100,60,100,0,0,100,0,100), nrow=5, byrow=TRUE)}
