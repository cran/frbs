\description{
Inference refers to the process of fuzzy reasoning.

\details{
In this function, fuzzy reasoning is conducted based on Mamdani and Takagi Sugeno Kang model.
Furthermore, there are some formula for conjunction and disjunction operators.

\bold{The Mamdani model:}
A fuzzy system with, e.g., two inputs \eqn{x1} and \eqn{x2} (antecedents) and a single output \eqn{y} (consequent)
is described by the following fuzzy IF-THEN rule:

\code{IF x1 is A1 and x2 is A2 THEN y is B}

where \eqn{A1} and \eqn{A2} are the fuzzy sets representing the antecent pairs and
\eqn{B} is the fuzzy set representing the consequent.

\bold{The Takagi Sugeno Kang model:}
Suppose we have two inputs \eqn{x1} and \eqn{x2} and output \eqn{y}, then the fuzzy IF-THEN rule is as follows:

\code{IF x1 is A1 and x2 is A2 THEN y is y = f(x1, x2)}

where \eqn{y = f(x1, x2)} is a crisp function in the consequent part which is usually a polynomial function,
and \eqn{A1} and \eqn{A2} are the fuzzy sets representing the antecent pairs.

Futhermore, this function has the following capabilities:
\itemize{
\item It supports unary operators (not) and binary operators (\code{AND} and \code{OR}).
\item It provides linguistic hedge (\code{extremely}, \code{very}, \code{somewhat}, and \code{slightly}).
\item there are several methods for the t-norm and s-norm.
