\title{The subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means (SBC) model building}
\usage{
SBC(data.train, range.data.ori, r.a = 0.5, eps.high = 0.5,
  eps.low = 0.15)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.train}{a matrix (\eqn{m \times n}) of data for the training process, where \eqn{m} is the number of instances and 
\eqn{n} is the number of variables; the last column is the output variable.}

\item{range.data.ori}{a matrix (\eqn{2 \times n}) containing the range of the data, where \eqn{n} is the number of variables, and
first and second rows are the minimum and maximum value, respectively.}

\item{r.a}{the radius defining a neighborhood.}

\item{eps.high}{an upper threshold value.}

\item{eps.low}{a lower threshold value.}

\description{
This is the internal function that implements a combination of the subtractive 
clustering method and fuzzy c-means. It is used to solve regression tasks. Users do not need to call it directly,
but just use \code{\link{frbs.learn}} and \code{\link{predict}}
}
\details{
This method was proposed by S. Chiu. For generating the rules 
in the learning phase, the subtractive clustering method is used to obtain the cluster 
centers. Subtractive clustering (SBC) is an extension of Yager and Filev's 
mountain method.
SBC considers each data point as a potential cluster center by determining 
the potential of a data point as a function of its distances to all the other 
data points. A data point has a high potential value if that data 
point has many nearby neighbors.
The highest potential is chosen as the cluster center and then the potential of 
each data point will be updated. The process of determining new clusters and updating 
potentials repeats until the remaining potential of all data points falls below 
some fraction  
of the potential of the first cluster center. After getting all the cluster 
centers from subtractive clustering,
the cluster centers are optimized by fuzzy c-means.
